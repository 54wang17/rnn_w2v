
Dependency:
- check requirements.txt for dependecy
- Need to download google word2vec pretrained model from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM and unzip it to data/ directory .

Data:
- train.txt (test.txt) one sentence per line
- train_label.txt(test_label.txt) corresponding label for the sentence in train.txt (test.txt)
- *.p is generated by program.




File:
- preprocess_data.py: 
    - generate corpus based on train.txt and test.txt.
    - generated index for each word in the corpus
    - transform each word in the sentence to its corresponding index.
    - output file: corpus.p
- word_embed.py
    - use Google pretrained word2vec model
    - find word embedding vector for each word in the corpus.p file, if no vector is found, randomly generated a vector for that word
    - change word embedding mapping key from word to its index in corpus.p file
    - output file: word2vec.p (this word embedding model only contains words appear in corpus.p)
- bacis_rnn.py
    - Basic RNN class
    - made several changes based on the RNN model in https://github.com/dennybritz/rnn-tutorial-rnnlm
    
- vanilla_rnn.py
    - based on baisc_rnn.py and vanilla rnn model from https://github.com/gwtaylor/theano-rnn
    - extend BasicRNN model from basic_rnn.py and make following changes
        - change parameters update approach to momentum 
        - add L1 and L2 regulation to cost function
        - add bias on layer function
- rnn_embd.py
    - an example of training basic rnn model and save training model under ./data directory
- model_test.py 
    - an example of loading pretrained rnn model and test model with test data from ./data directory
    - generate evaluation matrix for performance evaluation
- gru_rnn.py and other *.py files
    - still under development
